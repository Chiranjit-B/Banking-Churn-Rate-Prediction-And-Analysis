## 📁 **Project Structure**

- `Banking-Churn-Rate.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the code for data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## 📚 **Overview**

Customer churn is a critical issue for banks as retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project aims to analyze customer behavior, predict churn, and suggest strategies to reduce churn rates.

## 🔍 **Data Analysis**

We start with an in-depth analysis of the dataset to uncover key insights:

- **Credit Score Distribution**: Higher credit scores correlate with lower churn rates.
- **Age Analysis**: Younger customers exhibit higher churn rates.
- **Geographical Distribution**: Customers in Germany have higher churn rates.
- **Activity Status**: Inactive members are more likely to churn.

## 🧠 **Machine Learning Models**

We use several machine learning algorithms to predict customer churn, including:

- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**

## 📈 **Results**

The models are evaluated based on several metrics:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1 Score**

Confusion Matrix and Feature Importance plots are used for better understanding.

## 🎉 **Key Insights and Recommendations**

1. **Encourage Multi-Product Holding**: Convince customers to hold at least two banking products to enhance customer stickiness.
2. **Senior Citizen Schemes**: Launch specialized schemes for senior citizens to maintain their engagement with the bank.
3. **Rewards and Incentive Programs**: Implement robust rewards and incentive programs to keep customers engaged.
4. **Enhanced Digital Services**: Provide advanced digital services and regular updates to keep customers active.


## 🛠️ **Solution**

1. **Introduce Referral Programs**: 
   - Referral incentives can motivate existing customers to stay with the bank and help in acquiring new customers, thereby reducing churn.

2. **Flexible Loan Products**:
   - Attractive loan products can meet diverse customer needs and reduce the likelihood of customers switching to competitors.

3. **Exclusive Offers for Long-Term Customers**:
   - Recognizing and rewarding long-term customers can reinforce their loyalty and reduce the risk of churn.
